# Brand Kit

Search popular package repositories for available package names.

## Introduction

One of the hardest parts of starting a new open-source project is finding a suitable name for it.
Brand Kit helps you to search multiple popular package repositories (e.g. npm, PyPI, crates, etc.) for available package names.

## Usage

Visit [Brand Kit](https://brand-kit.vercel.app) and enter your desired brand.
Brand Kit will search multiple package repositories and tell you if it's available.

> [!WARNING]
> Before registering a package name or domain, please confirm availability with each registry, and run a trademark search if necessary.
> Brand Kit is not responsible for any name collisions or trademark disputes.
